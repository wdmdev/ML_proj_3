Introduction to machine learning project 3: Clustering, anomaly detection, and association mining

A machine learning project from my course Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining on the third semester of my BSc Eng. in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence at The Technical University of Denmark

The focus of this The purpose of this report is to perform clustering, anomaly detection, and association mining on a dataset consisting of key figures from Danish municipalities from 1993-2019.

## Methods used
1. Gaussian Mixture Model for clustering
2. Gaussian Kernel Density, KNN Density, and KNN Average Relative Density for anormaly detection
3. Apriori algorithm
